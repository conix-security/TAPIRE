TAPIRE: Tool for Assisting Protocol Inference and Reverse Engineering
==========================================

Needs a modified version of NETZOB (netgoblin fork) in order to make efficient use of all methods.

Includes:
=========
* IPseeker
* Displays PCAPS using the netzob displayer or scapy
* Most netzob methods.

TODO:
=====
* Finish the RelationFinder
* Implement the CRC32 Finder
* Get netzob log output for IPseeker and CRC32 finder
* Finsih the EntropyFinder (To detect possible cryptofunctions)
